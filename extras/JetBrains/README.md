# JetBrains IntelliJ Monokai DarkPlus Color Scheme

## How to install

Since this is just a editor theme you just need to download the **Monokai_DarkPlus.icls** or **Monokai_DarkPlus_Darcula.icls** file on this directory.

Then go to:

On the `Editor color scheme:` click on the gear icon on the right and then click on `Import Scheme` and next click on `Intellij IDEA color scheme (.icls) or (.jar)`.
Finally select theme theme file on your computer.
